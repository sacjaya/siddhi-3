Siddhi Complex Event Processing Engine 
======================================
###  v 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Siddhi CEP is a lightweight, easy-to-use Open Source Complex Event Processing
Engine (CEP) under  Apache Software License v2.0. Siddhi CEP processes
events which are triggered by various event sources and notifies appropriate complex events
according to the user specified queries.

This project was started as a research project initiated at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka,
and now being improved by WSO2 Inc.


Features Supported
------------------
 - Filter
    - Uses inputStream handlers to filter events
 - Join
    - Supports only upto two streams at a time
    - Match operation triggering can be configured (making "left" or "right" or both streams to trigger)
 - Aggregation
    - By default shipped with Avg, Sum , Min, Max
    - Supports Custom Aggregations via the plugable architecture
 - Group by
    - Supports Group by based on more than one attribute
    - Supported for all type if queries
 - Having
    - Supported for all type if queries
 - Stream handlers
    - Supports multiple handlers in a row per inputStream
    - By default shipped with  Filter and Window
    - Default implementations to windows are: Time window, Time Batch window, Length window
    - Supports Custom Stream handlers via the plugable architecture
 - Conditions and Expressions
    - Implemented from scratch
    - Mvel2 support removed
    - Conditions supported are: and, or, not, true/false, ==,!=, >=, >, <=, <
    - Expressions supported are: boolean, string, int, long, float, double
 - Pattern processing
    - Identifies pattern occurrences within streams
    - Supports "every" conditions
    - Can process two inputStream at a time via "and" and "or" conditions (currently only works on two simple streams)
    - Can collect events, with min and max limit, using "collect" condition (currently only works on a simple inputStream)
 - Sequence processing
    - Identifies continuous sequences with in streams
    - Supports "or" conditions on streams (currently only works on two simple streams)
    - Supports zero to many, one to many, and zero to one  (currently only works on a simple inputStream)
 - Event Tables
    - Support for using historical data in realtime processing
    - Can process with the in-memory or MYSQL based data collection
 - Query Language
    - Implemented on Antlr
    - Supports Query, Stream Definition and Query Plan compilation
